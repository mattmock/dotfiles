# Machine-specific Git configuration
# Copy this file to ~/.gitconfig.local and customize for your setup

# Example: Conditional includes for multiple Git identities
# Uncomment and modify the paths below for your personal and work projects

# [includeIf "gitdir:~/Projects/"]
# 	path = ~/.gitconfig-personal
# [includeIf "gitdir:~/Work/"]
# 	path = ~/.gitconfig-work

# Then create the identity files:
# ~/.gitconfig-personal:
#   [user]
#       name = Your Name
#       email = personal@example.com

# ~/.gitconfig-work:
#   [user]
#       name = Your Name
#       email = work@example.com
